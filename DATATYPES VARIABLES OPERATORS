#include<iostrem>:: 
HEADER FILE THAT LETS U WORK WITH INPUT OUTPUT OBJECTS SUCH AS COUT CIN ETC
using namespace std::
WE CAN USE NAMES FOR OBJECTS AND VARIABLES FROM STANDARD LIBRARY.
int main() {     }:::
IT IS MAIN FUNCTION AND ALL CODES WRITTEN INSIDE THIS { } WILL BE EXECUTED.

Compilation process:::
SOURCE CODE IS CONVERTED INTO MACHINE EXECUTABLE FORMAT BY COMPILER . THEN IT WILL RUN AND GIVE THE RESULT.
COMPILER HELPS IN CONVERSION INTO BINARY LANG AS WELL AS TO FIND ERRORS IN CODE.

IDE ( INTEGRATED DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT ):::
Environment where we can write codes as well as run it easily .

% OPERATOR:::
It gives us the remainder 
5 % 3 = 2
6 % 2 = 0
SO,
n % 2 = 0 :: n is even
n % 2 = 1 :: n is odd

DATATYPES AND VARIABLES:::
int a = 5;
variable name is a and its type is integer . memory size = 4byte = 32bits .
and 5 will be stored in it . 

DataType   	Size	               Description
bool      1byte	           Stores true or false values.. true=1 false=0
char	    1byte            Stores a single character/letter/number, or ASCII values
int      	2or4 bytes	     Stores whole numbers, without decimals
float     4 bytes	        Stores fractional numbers, containing one or more decimals. Sufficient for storing 6-7 decimal digits
double	  8 bytes       	Stores fractional numbers, containing one or more decimals. Sufficient for storing 15 decimal digits

1)
bool b=2;
cout<<b;
>>> 1
 
 b      cout
 0       0
 0.12    1
 -0.09   1
 4567    1
 true    1
 false   0
 
 2)
 char ::: stores single characters.. uses single quotes ..
 uses ASCII values to display characters..
 char C=67;
 cout<<C;
 >>>C
